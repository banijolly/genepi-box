## About the Protocol
The **Computational Protocol for Assembly and Analysis of SARS-nCoV-2 Genomes** has been compiled by VS-Lab at [CSIR-Insitute of Genomics an Integrative Biology](https://www.igib.res.in/) as an effort to aid analysis and interpretation of the sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2 using easy-to-use open source utilities using both reference-guided and de novo based strategies.

This README document illustrates the prerequisites and installations steps required to run the pipeline for paired-end samples. For a detailed description of the steps involved in this protocol along with the commands used, please read the [Analysis Steps](https://github.com/banijolly/Genepi/blob/master/Analysis_Steps.md) document.

More information about the lab and our work on COVID-19 can be found at the [lab website](http://vinodscaria.genomes.in/).
